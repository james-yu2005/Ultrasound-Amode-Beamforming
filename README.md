## Ultrasound Beamforming Algorithm

This project implements an **ultrasound beamforming algorithm** in **C++** using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles. Key features include:

- **Beamforming Calculation**: Developed an algorithm based on beamforming formulas to process ultrasound data.
- **Data Processing**: Ingested and transformed two datasets, converting raw data into **Excel**-compatible points for **visualization**.
- **Visualization**: Prepared the data for easy **visualization**, enabling insights into beamforming performance and outcomes.
